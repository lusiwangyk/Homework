Coding Boot Camp Homework 

02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework:Responsive Portfolio

This is my homework for Unit 2. I created three html files portfolio.html, index.html, and contact.html. I don't know whether I should build extra css fils or not. So I add css in the html files. I know I should not do this in the real job. The webpages contains three different parts:
1.Navbar
2.Container
3.Footer

The Navbar and Container are responsive and the Footer is fixed at the bottom.
